        <p>Hello! We, the EduStats team, warmly welcome you to our website! This team includes students Kalani Davis, Asmi Jain, Upasana Manem, Valerie Tai, and Adriana Zambrano. We created this website for a project in a coding camp, Kode With Klossy. Our goal is to spread awareness for countries around the world with this website EduStats. This features four of the least educated countries in the world. By surfing this website, you can donate to foundations to help improve their schools. Though this website only has four of these countries, there are many more countries in need of the support. Please make sure to give these other countries support as well! We also want to say thank you to Kode With Klossy for giving us the opportunity to create such a great website and teach us so many things about data science.</p>
